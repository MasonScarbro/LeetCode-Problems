# LeetCode-Problems-Ive-Done
Leet code is a website used to prepare for interviews in coding. However it can be used to better understand the language your using and to increase expierence.
BOTH JAVA AND C++ are used (not just C++)
IN PROGRESS is just for me any in progress that is completed will be transfered and deleted from IN PROGRESS (I am only using this to save my progress when I need to quickly leave and cant continue the problem)
